# 🔍 Customer Churn Analysis (Python)

## 🚀 Project Summary

This project simulates how a telecom company can use **Python and machine learning** to reduce revenue loss from customer churn.  
I cleaned real-world churn data, engineered features, visualized patterns, and built a **logistic regression model** to predict which customers are likely to leave.

It reflects the kind of **retention insights** that can drive proactive customer support or marketing campaigns.

## 🧠 Business Problem

Telecom companies lose significant revenue when high-value customers churn.  
By identifying churn-prone customers in advance, they can launch retention offers, better plans, or customer care outreach.

This project demonstrates how I can use **data + Python to solve business problems.**

## 📌 Key Steps Performed

1. 🧹 Cleaned and preprocessed the Telco dataset  
2. 📊 Visualized churn across contract types, tenure, internet usage  
3. 🎯 Performed feature engineering with one-hot encoding  
4. 🧪 Trained Logistic Regression using scikit-learn  
5. ✅ Achieved ~**[your model accuracy]% accuracy** on test set  
6. 💾 Exported final model with Joblib (`churn_model.pkl`)

## 📈 Visual: Churn by Contract Type

**Insight**: Month-to-month customers have the **highest churn rate**, indicating flexibility may come at a business cost.

## 🧠 Real-World Use Case

> At Wipro, I supported data delivery and transformation for Defined Contribution clients.  
> If I were automating a retention system, this kind of churn analysis could be used to **trigger client alerts** when a user fits a churn profile — enabling real-time decision-making.

## 🔁 Future Improvements

- Try Random Forest or Gradient Boosting models  
- Add customer segmentation (RFM scoring)  
- Convert notebook into a Streamlit app for demos  
- Integrate with SQL or cloud for batch scoring
